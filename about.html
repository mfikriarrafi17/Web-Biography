         <p>My name is Rafi, and my full name is Muhammad Fikri Arrafi. I aspire to become a web developer or software developer. I am a student at Universitas Darma Persada, majoring in Information Systems. I chose this major based on my parents' advice. Initially, I struggled with the coursework because I had very little knowledge or skills in Computer Science. I am from a religiously-based boarding school, and I never thought about my current aspirations because I only wanted to be a religious figure. But I believe that the path which Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala has chosen is best. I hope someday I can have both. However, as time went on, I worked hard to adapt by praying and studying diligently to achieve my goals.</p>
